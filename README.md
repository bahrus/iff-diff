# iff-diff


iff-diff is a simplified version of [if-diff](https://github.com/bahrus/if-diff).  iff-diff only affects its next sibling.

iff-diff supports setting (or removing) an attribute, a class, and/or a part from that next sibling, depending on the specified condition.  

That is all.

iff-diff might be used in combination with a lazy loading component, like [laissez-dom](https://github.com/bahrus/laissez-dom) or [lazy-mt](https://github.com/bahrus/lazy-mt).

## Example Syntax

```html
<!-- p-et-alia notation -->
<iff-diff -if -lhs -equals -rhs set-attr="some-attribute" set-class="some-class" set-part="some-part"></iff-diff>
<div></div>
```

Other options to "equals" are "not-equals" and "includes".

lhs, rhs can be strings, numbers, or objects (in which case the two objects are compared recursively.)

## Shared condition

Multiple iff-diffs can share the results of a single iff-diff instance:

```html
<iff-diff id=source-of-truth -if -lhs -equals -rhs set-attr="some-attribute" set-class="some-class" set-part="some-part"></iff-diff>
<div></div>
...
<iff-diff sync-with=source-of-truth set-class="some-other-class"></iff-diff>
<span></span>
```

Restrictions:  

1.  This only works for instances within the same ShadowDOM realm.
